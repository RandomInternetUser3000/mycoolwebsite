                <h1>Rebuilding My Roblox Combat System From Scratch</h1>
                <p class="lead">I rewrote the entire combat loop to be faster, fairer, and easier to extend. Here's the breakdown of what changed and why the upgrade was worth the effort.</p>
            </header>

            <div class="blog-article-content">
                <p>When I first prototyped combat for my Roblox project, the goal was simple: hit detection that "felt" right. Months later the codebase was a spaghetti bowl of remote events, server-side guesses, and duct tape cooldowns. The rewrite replaces every piece of that foundation with something intentional.</p>

                <h2>What Was Holding the Old System Back</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A single hitbox meant wide swings and tight pokes behaved the same.</li>
                    <li>Client prediction drifted every few seconds, so blocking felt random.</li>
                    <li>Animation state checks were tied to frame events, not actual timing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Instead of patching each bug, I listed the sensations I wanted players to feel—snappy confirms, punishable misses, and readable blocks. Anything that didn't support those outcomes went on the chopping block.</p>

                <h2>The New Foundation</h2>
                <p>The rewrite centers around modular abilities. Each ability defines its own hit windows, stamina taxes, and visual effects, then plugs into a shared state machine. That gives me granular control and cleaner testing.</p>

                <blockquote>"The biggest win was separating animation pacing from damage timing. Once those two systems stopped fighting each other, every combo suddenly clicked."</blockquote>

                <p>On top of that, I built dashboards that track hit accuracy, block success, and combo drops per session. Data beats vibes when you're balancing PvP.</p>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Two features are still in the lab: directional dodges and weapon-specific perks. Directional dodges need bespoke camera easing, and perks require UI updates so players actually notice them. Expect more updates once those hit testing.</p>
